## How it Works

Steamauth acts as a secure bridge between your Steam account and supported third-party websites.

1. **Integration**: Websites integrate with Steamauth to request specific data (like your trade URL or inventory).
2. **User Confirmation**: When a website requests access, Steamauth will prompt you for confirmation.
3. **Secure Transfer**: Upon your approval, Steamauth fetches the necessary data directly from Steam and shares it with the website. Your login credentials are never shared.
